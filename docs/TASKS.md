# Svelte LogViewer Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the Svelte LogViewer project. Tasks are organized by category and should be completed in the order presented for optimal results.

## Code Structure and Architecture

1. [x] Refactor the connection handling logic to reduce duplication between WebSocket and EventSource implementations
2. [ ] Create a common abstract class or interface for different log sources (text, URL, WebSocket, EventSource)
3. [ ] Extract the resize observer logic into a separate utility or hook
4. [ ] Implement a more robust error handling strategy with consistent error reporting across different data sources
5. [ ] Remove the empty types.ts file or implement its intended purpose
6. [ ] Split the large log-viewer.svelte file into smaller, more focused components
7. [ ] Create a dedicated state management solution for complex state interactions

## Performance Optimizations

8. [ ] Optimize the line processing logic to handle very large log files more efficiently
9. [ ] Replace setTimeout for auto-scrolling with a more reliable approach using requestAnimationFrame
10. [ ] Implement memoization for expensive computations like search matching
11. [ ] Add virtualization for horizontal scrolling for very wide log lines
12. [ ] Optimize the ANSI color parsing for better performance with large logs
13. [ ] Implement incremental search to avoid blocking the UI when searching large logs

## Feature Enhancements

14. [ ] Add support for log filtering by severity levels or custom patterns
15. [ ] Implement collapsible log groups for structured logs
16. [ ] Add timestamp-based navigation for logs with timestamps
17. [ ] Implement syntax highlighting for common log formats (JSON, XML, etc.)
18. [ ] Add the ability to export logs or selected portions to file
19. [ ] Implement a dark/light theme toggle
20. [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions (search, navigation, etc.)

## Testing Improvements

21. [ ] Add tests for the EventSource client similar to the WebSocket client tests
22. [ ] Increase test coverage for the main LogViewer component
23. [ ] Add visual regression tests for UI components
24. [ ] Implement performance benchmarks for critical operations
25. [ ] Add accessibility tests to ensure the component is usable by everyone
26. [ ] Create more comprehensive integration tests covering all major features

## Documentation

27. [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation with examples for all props
28. [ ] Add inline code documentation for complex functions
29. [ ] Create a contributing guide for new contributors
30. [ ] Document the internal architecture and data flow
31. [ ] Add more examples in the Storybook demonstrating different use cases
32. [ ] Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Build and Development Experience

33. [ ] Set up automated release process with semantic versioning
34. [ ] Implement stricter TypeScript configurations for better type safety
35. [ ] Add bundle size monitoring to prevent unexpected increases
36. [ ] Optimize the build configuration for faster development cycles
37. [ ] Set up continuous integration with automated testing
38. [ ] Add code quality metrics and monitoring

## Accessibility and Usability

39. [ ] Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
40. [ ] Add proper ARIA attributes for screen readers
41. [ ] Implement focus management for better keyboard navigation
42. [ ] Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards
43. [ ] Add internationalization support for UI elements
44. [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile devices

## Browser Compatibility

45. [ ] Test and fix any issues in older browsers
46. [ ] Implement polyfills for missing browser features
47. [ ] Add browser compatibility information to documentation
48. [ ] Create browser-specific styles for consistent appearance

## Security

49. [ ] Implement content security policy recommendations
50. [ ] Add sanitization for log content to prevent XSS attacks
51. [ ] Audit and update dependencies for security vulnerabilities
52. [ ] Add secure defaults for network connections

## Performance Monitoring

53. [ ] Implement performance monitoring for runtime performance
54. [ ] Add telemetry options for error reporting (opt-in)
55. [ ] Create performance profiles for different usage scenarios
56. [ ] Add memory usage monitoring for large logs
